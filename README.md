DEF filings for YAHOO calculating stock trend analysis for Yahoo 
<B> First we collected all the previous year data from sec.gov site. As the data was in Excel spreadsheet we started cleansing the data in R by Reading the excel spreadsheet using readlines functions or read.table.
Then we clean the "" / and spaces from that file using FREP function.
Using cat function we can store the files and then make summary of those files and using mapping functions we mapped the files.
By installing packages like GGPLOT, WORD CLOUD , bar plot we calcutaed which are the most used words by YAHOO in DEF filings.
WHY YAhoo didnot file for year 2007.
We plotted the graph for the count of top used words in text files.
